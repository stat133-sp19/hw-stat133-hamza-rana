## Binomial Package

This package allows you to create and manipulate custom binomial variables and distributions. After binomial distributions are created, they can be visualized through graphs or can be printed. Functions of measures can also be summarized and outputted for each distribution. This package allows for the creations of two types of distributions: simple binomial distributions and cumulative distributions. 

## Creating a Binomial Distribution

```{r}
# Creating the binomial variable
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 20, prob = 0.5)
bin1

# Viewing summary statistics of the variable
summary(bin1)

# Statistics can be viewed singularly as well
bin_mean(trials = 20, prob = 0.5)

# Using bin_choose to calculate the number of combinations, which will be used to create the binomial distribution
bin_choose(n = 20, k = 5)

# Calculating the probability value with certain parameters
bin_probability(success = 5, trials = 20, prob = 0.5)

# Creating a binomial distribution with the same parameters
bin_distribution(trials = 20, prob = 0.5)

# Creating a cumulative binomial distribution with the same parameters
bin_cumulative(trials = 20, prob = 0.5)

```

## Including Plots of the Distributions

```{r}
plot(bin_distribution(trials = 20, prob = 0.5))
plot(bin_cumulative(trials = 20, prob = 0.5))
```
