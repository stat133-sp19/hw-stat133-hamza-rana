This assignment involves the creation of a new "binomial" package, in which many functions and methods are combined to allow for the manipulation of binomial variables and distributions. Various calculations can be done on the values, and the distributions can be plotted on a graph or simply printed in order to help visualize the data. The package also includes various tests to make sure that each function takes the correct parameters and outputs the correct values.
